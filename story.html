    <p><font face="verdana" font size="4">Hi, my name is <font color=red>Jordan Amberg,</font color=red> and your probably wondering how I ended up here.
    It's a very long story. My job is to capture the Kalebs of the world.
    It's funny because they never expect it and you just hit em with the hairnet.
    They usually look like sasquatch because they never cut their hair and they have
    no ambition to get better at fortnite. Kalebs are the people that wear their friends
    ear buds and do naughty things inside of tech class.

    I intend to imprison all of the Kalebs of the world and they won't even know
    I'm coming. I think I would really improve today's society if all the Kalebs
    were exterminated. Although they do make good programmers because their looking
    for people that don't think normal. Eventually I'll finish North America and
    I'll have to move on to my next location. I intend to travel to Africa to
    continue my job there. My job isn't too difficult because <font color=blue>most Kalebs aren't
    too bright,</font color=blue> and they usually just walk right up into my traps. That's all for
    todays episode! Ill see ya later!</font></font></p>
